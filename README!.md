#Problem Statement for "Movie Club Society"

##This is the Problem Statement for Mod 1 project. A website that has at least three pages and fetches third party Api.
My Site is "Movie Club Society". The current Covid Pandemic changed a lot of things for many people. One of the things that I was 
really missing was the ability to go see a movie with my friends and family. It is exciting to see a new movie on the big screen for the first time and
it is a very hard feeling to replace. But we couldnt do it safely. We had to think outside the box. Hence Movie Club Society. What is it?
The rules are very simple. Every week we (my two movie going buds and I) take turns picking out a movie. We watch it, we talk about it, we rate it. Very easy.
One movie a week, of any genre or age, that we all either enjoy or suffer through, depending on the pick. I have seen some great movies this way and I have seen some hot pieces 
of garbage this way. There are a few other simple rules. During the month of October it has to be a scary movie. During the month of December it has to be a Holiday movie. 
If it happens to be your birthday month you get to pick one extra movie. The movie can never be the all girl reboot of Ghostbusters. Four simple rules. Not only does this help us
feed our need for movies but it also exposes us to films we would have never picked (or even heard of) otherwise. Have you ever scrolled Netflix for an hour because you cant 
decide? Movie Club Society is an easy out for that situation. An idealistic end for Movie club is for it to become its own Anti-subcription service. You would pay some small fee.
A dollar? And then you could watch the movie for that week and that week only. Then we would like to hear from the user as to what they think about the movie. Using our data
to help promote movies young and old. This is the perfect site for someone who loves movies and isnt afraid to watch something outside their wheelhouse. The site will work like this;
Users will log on to see what is the movie of the week. Movies will be posted every Monday at 8pm. Everyone has one week to watch the movie and write what they thought about it and 
give it a rating. You will be able to cycle through past weeks to see past movies should you want an idea of something good or horrible to watch. Thank you for your time.
